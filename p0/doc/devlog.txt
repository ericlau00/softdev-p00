gorbachevY -- 2019-10-20 21:37
    Push more boiler plate code

lauE -- 2019-10-21 20:42
    Never be afraid to ask questions about something you don't, even if they are really small.
    Never be afraid to suggest and ask for better ways to do something.
    Make meaningful comments on your code
    Review each other's code after every commit to make sure you understand its use, and to make sure its free of errors
    Stick to the basics. Don't get caught up in libraries or use things that you don't fully understand

    INNER-JOIN
    returns rows from the A table that only has the corresponding row in B table.
    It would be useful when querying for blogs when you’re looking at a user’s profile

    CROSS-JOIN
    It combines every row from the first table (table1) with every row from the second table (table2) to form the result set.
    Don't currently see a use case for this

    LEFT-JOIN
    Returns a result set that includes:
    - Rows in table A (left table) that have corresponding rows in table B.
    - Rows in the table A table and the rows in the table B filled with NULL values in case the row from table A does not have any corresponding rows in table B.
    It would be useful when querying for entries that belong to a blog or comments that belong to an entry because there may not be anything in those sets and it would be useful to know that they are NULL.
